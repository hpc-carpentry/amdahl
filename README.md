# What does this package do?

This python module contains a pseudo-application that can be used as a black
box to reproduce Amdahl's Law. It does not do real calculations, nor any real
communication, so can easily be overloaded.

The application is installed as a python module with a shell
script wrapper. The only requirement is MPI4PY.
